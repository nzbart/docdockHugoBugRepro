# docdock / Hugo summary bug repro

Steps to reproduce:

1. Clone this repo.
2. Run VerifySummariesAreGenerated.ps1. Unfortunately, this is Windows-only, but hopefully it's easy enough to manually reproduce on non-Windows platforms or via [PowerShell on Linux](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/installation/linux.md).
